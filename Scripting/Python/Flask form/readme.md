# Project: Form in Python with Flask

### Duration: 5 days

 - 1 Day to learn about Flask: https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/4425066-concevez-un-site-avec-flask
 - 4 Days to complete the project.

### Skills worked

 - Backend: PYTHON programming (introduction to logical structures)
 - Sanitation and validation of a form
 - Implementing POST and GET methods
 - Implementing templates with Jinja

### Problem situation

The Hackers Poulette ™ company sells kits and accessories for Rasperri Pi to assemble yourself. It wants to allow its users to contact its technical support. Your mission: develop a script in python, allowing you to display a contact form and process its response: sanitation, validation, then sending and feedback to the user.
Performance criteria

- If the user makes an error, return the form to them, with the valid answers given in their respective inputs.
- Ideally: display error messages near their respective field.
- The form will perform serverside sanitization and validation
- If sanitization and validation are ok, a “Thank you for contacting us” page. will be displayed with a summary of all the encoded information.
- Implementing the honeypot anti-spam technique

Form fields: first & last name + email + country (list) + message + gender (M/F) (Radio box) + 3 possible subjects ((Repair, Order, Others) must be checkboxes). All fields are required, except subject (in this case, value = "Other")
Contact form (Python)

- presentation: server/client architecture (transmissive, 10")
- sanitization: neutralize any harmful encoding
- validation: required fields + Valid Email
- Sending + Feedback
- NO NEED FOR JAVASCRIPT OR CSS
